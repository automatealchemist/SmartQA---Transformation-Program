# SmartQA - Transformation Program

## About This Repository  
This repository captures my learnings, insights, and reflections from the **SmartQA - Transformation Program** by **Ashok Thiruvengadam**. This **two-month program** with weekly sessions is designed to shift the testing mindset, refine activities, enhance outcomes, and maximize business value. The focus is on **practical transformation rather than rigid processes**, emphasizing habit formation and continuous improvement.

## Program Approach  
SmartQA is based on a methodology that integrates the **science and engineering of testing** with a structured approach to transformation. The program consists of:

- **Nudge & Transform** – Cultivating new habits through small but impactful questions.
- **Reflect & Change** – Weekly open-ended reflections with no absolute right or wrong answers.
- **Enable Action** – Driving implementation through discussions and clarifications, both online and offline.

Rather than discarding existing practices, SmartQA refines and elevates them. It is a **practice-driven** approach where learning is iterative—we experiment, make mistakes, reflect, and grow.

## Repository Structure  
This repository is structured to provide **organized, actionable insights** from the program:

- **Week-wise Notes** – Key takeaways and concepts discussed in each session.
- **Tools & Techniques** – Practical insights into testing methodologies explored.
- **Reflections & Applications** – Personal takeaways and real-world applications of SmartQA principles.

Regular updates will be made as new insights and learnings emerge.
