**Question** - Should QA be viewed as a customer-based expansion?
**Opinion** : *QA should also be viewed as Enabler of customer-based expansion*, it does not mean that quality or engineering teams are expected to sell or do marketing directly. What is being stressed here is the importance of having a mindset that connects quality with the overall business value. The idea is that quality work can lead to better customer experiences. When customers have a smooth and satisfying experience, they are more likely to buy again or explore other products. This is what is meant by enabling customer expansion.

It is about realizing that quality teams are not limited to just engineering tasks. Their work has an impact on other business functions like sales, marketing, or customer support. **By thinking from a larger business perspective, quality professionals can contribute more meaningfully.** If this broader view is adopted, it can lead to better decision-making and better results, both for the customer and the business.

>A probe in software testing is not limited to just test cases, scenarios, or checklists. It refers to any act of exploring or examining the software more deeply and broadly. The idea is that testing should involve more than just following predefined steps. It should also include questioning, investigating, and thinking critically.

**Probing is a mindset. It could involve asking thoughtful questions, looking for unexpected behaviors, or exploring the technology used in the software to uncover potential risks.** Probing is not always sharp or specific like a test case. Instead, it can start with a broad idea or a question that leads to the creation of a test later.

*The concept of probing also involves using human thinking and curiosity.* It can lead to new ideas, improvements, or even suggestions for better testing. In today's world, tools like GenAI can assist this process. If a person has a probing mindset, they can use GenAI to ask meaningful questions about the software, its use, potential issues, or technologies. The tool can give ideas, highlight risks, or offer new perspectives. This helps a person think better, but the value depends on how meaningful the prompt is.

**Prompts and probes are not exactly the same. A prompt is just a question or input to the tool, while a probe is a deeper, more thoughtful inquiry. When used with purpose, prompts become part of the probing process.** This makes the use of tools like GenAI more intelligent and valuable. The quality of what one gets out of the tool depends on how well they probe, not just on asking random or shallow questions.
