**Question** - Should QA be viewed as a customer-based expansion?<br>
**Thoughts** : *QA should also be viewed as Enabler of customer-based expansion*, it does not mean that quality or engineering teams are expected to sell or do marketing directly. What is being stressed here is the importance of having a mindset that connects quality with the overall business value. The idea is that quality work can lead to better customer experiences. When customers have a smooth and satisfying experience, they are more likely to buy again or explore other products. This is what is meant by enabling customer expansion.

It is about realizing that quality teams are not limited to just engineering tasks. Their work has an impact on other business functions like sales, marketing, or customer support. **By thinking from a larger business perspective, quality professionals can contribute more meaningfully.** If this broader view is adopted, it can lead to better decision-making and better results, both for the customer and the business.

# Understanding Probing in Software Testing

When we think about **probing** in software testing, it is not just about running through a list of test cases or ticking boxes on a checklist. It goes a bit deeper than that. A probe is more like a thoughtful nudge, it could be a *question*, an *observation*, a *hunch*, or even a *random idea* that suddenly pops into your head while exploring a product.

Probing is all about being curious. It is driven by the desire to understand how a system works, where it might behave unexpectedly, or where it might quietly fail without anyone noticing. And the interesting part? It often starts with something as simple as a “What if?” and might eventually lead to formal testing, but it does not have to start there.

## Probing: A Thinking Process

In that way, probing is more of a **thinking process** than a testing step. Imagine testing an app that is new to you. You might not know all the details about its flow or the risks it carries. But probing helps fill in those blanks. You start by asking questions like:

- *What if someone uses this in a way we did not plan for?*  
- *Is there something shaky about the tech stack being used here?*

These questions open up new directions in your mind and often take you to areas you would not have checked otherwise.

## Intellectual Effort & Human Skills

Probing also invites a different kind of effort the **intellectual one**. It draws on your:

- Past experience  
- Instincts  
- Domain knowledge  
- Ability to spot patterns or oddities

That is something a scripted test case might miss, but a curious mind would not. So a probe is not just a task it is a method of discovering what lies beneath the surface.

## The Role of GenAI in Probing

Today, we have tools like **GenAI** that can help us probe even better. But it is not about throwing random prompts at it. The real value shows up when you ask **meaningful**, **focused** questions, questions that come from understanding the problem well.

### For example:

- *What are the usual pain points in apps built with this framework?*  
- *If this feature is used every day, what kind of performance issues might show up over time?*

These are not just prompts, they are **purposeful probes**. And that intent is what makes all the difference.

> A prompt is simply what you type. A probe is the thinking behind it.

If your intent is sharp, the tool becomes more than a helper, it becomes a thoughtful assistant that can guide your next move, spark new ideas, or point to hidden risks. Some of its suggestions might hit the mark. Some might not. But when you have a probing mindset, you know how to filter and follow the useful threads.

---

So, to sum it up **probing is about staying curious, asking good questions, and exploring beyond what is obvious**. It is not about chasing perfection or relying only on test cases. It is about digging deeper to really understand how the system behaves.

When the goal is to build something reliable and user-friendly, this approach adds real value because now, you are not just testing **you are learning, discovering, and helping shape a better product**.

# A Thoughtful Take on Smart QA and Probing in Testing

Testing is not a single-lens activity. It is a blend of process and practice, a multidimensional approach that invites different perspectives. Instead of chasing more, the goal shifts toward doing less but achieving more. There are many ways to approach this, and one such approach comes through a method known as **Hibist** a smart QA technique shared as part of a coaching journey.

## Probing: A Three-Phase Activity

The idea of probing in software testing is not about randomly digging into things. It follows a thoughtful rhythm, a **three-phase cycle** that shapes how testers investigate systems.

### 1. Reconnaissance

This phase is like scouting the land before beginning an expedition. It involves early exploration to understand the broader system landscape. Just like someone planning a mountain trek would study maps and get a sense of the terrain, the same principle applies here. This phase helps plant the first seeds of learning. One does not dive deep right away. Instead, the goal is to gather enough information to form a mental map before going further.

### 2. Exploration

Once the initial landscape is understood, exploration takes over. This phase is more immersive. It blends both breadth and depth, depending on the system being tested. At this stage, testers begin to design experiments, execute them, collect observations, and make sense of patterns. It is about diving deeper where necessary while still keeping a wide lens when required.

### 3. Recoup

After collecting data and going through an exploration, this phase is about stepping back. It involves sitting down to assess what has been learnt, reviewing whether the direction taken is meaningful, and identifying if something needs to change. This phase reflects, evaluates, and prepares for the next round.

The entire process moves in cycles, from reconnaissance to exploration to recoup and repeats with better focus and deeper understanding each time. When done with intention and concentration, it turns into what is known as a **hypothesis-based session** or **immersive session**.

## The Role of Techniques and Principles

A natural question arises, how does one do reconnaissance meaningfully? Is it purely based on experience, or are there techniques to support it?

The answer lies in combining both. There are **key concepts** that help, often logical and left-brain in nature. Alongside, there are **key practices** that shape habits and guide exploration, often tied to the creative right-brain. These techniques and habits evolve over time and become second nature.

Some of these concepts apply best in the early reconnaissance phase. Others help more during exploration or while recouping. Each phase requires its own toolkit, and the idea is to learn how to apply them wisely over time.

## Connecting to the Test Lifecycle

If mapped to a simple test lifecycle, the phases align as follows:

- **Reconnaissance** connects with analysis
- **Exploration** brings in planning, designing, and evaluating
- **Recoup** connects back to assessment and correction

This view makes it easier to see how the cycle supports the entire test journey. Initially, it may not be easy to dive deep, especially in large or complex systems. The starting point is often about getting a bigger picture by reading documentation, looking at existing data, understanding constraints, and forming mental maps.

These maps might focus on different things features, risks, flows, or even assumptions. Once built, they guide the deeper parts of testing.

This approach to testing is less about ticking boxes and more about thinking with purpose. Probing becomes a meaningful act when done with clarity. It combines awareness, curiosity, and deliberate effort. And in the long run, it leads to better decisions, sharper focus, and more value from the entire testing process.


**Key Concepts in Hibist**

Key concepts in the Hibist approach are not fixed formulas. Sometimes they show up as **clear techniques**, sometimes as **broader principles**, and sometimes just as **general guidelines**. It all depends on how well the problem is understood and how much structure is needed to solve it.

If the problem is well-defined, there might be a **technique** that feels like a direct solution. If it is not that clear, then it may turn into a **principle** that gives direction without exact steps. And if even that is missing, then it might just remain a **guideline or heuristic** picked up from experience.

This mix of **granularity** makes it practical.  
Some of these are more useful during **reconnaissance**, when the aim is to get a feel of the landscape.  
Others come in handy while **exploring** in depth.  
A few work better in the **recoup** phase, where learning and reflection take over.

It is not about applying everything at once.  
It is about knowing **what fits where** and using it with **focus**.
