# Introduction (Preamble): 

 - Limited View of Testing: We usually consider testing as an act of doing writing, executing test cases, etc., but that is a limited view, testing is not just about doing these tasks but also about questioning 
 -Incorrect Dichotomy: Manual and automation testing are incorrect dichotomy as automation testing is considered to be aid of manual testing, also some something is either manual task or automation task,
 - Incomplete View of Testing: Considering testing as the bounded task of possibly compliance / checking however, in real testing, it should not be bounded to these tasks Instead, testing should be an act of exploring the software, discovering something that has not been discovered yet, and finding something new 
 - Limited Approach to Testing: Approach can be limited as people rely too much on documentation however, in reality, there should be a balance between execution and documentation 
 - False Trust: People also think that automated testing may be superior to manual testing however, that's not the case
 - Myth of Testing: Another thought is that testing is driven by experience. However, testing is not totally dependent on experience, having experience adds value to testing depending on how much we have learn from our mistakes. Experience is polished by discipline. When we do something with discipline, we gain experience we become good, but not just by experience but also with a certain amount of formalism and ability to apply the formalism, which is ultimately embellished by experience.


# The TRANSFORMATION FOCUS 

 Doing vs. Probing: Instead of seeing testing as an act of doing, we should focus on seeing testing as an act of constantly probing intelligence.
 - Process vs Practice - Again, when it comes to testing, instead of just focusing of the process of doing the testing, we should also see it as the practice of testing, i.e. how we do.
 - Machine vs Intellect - Instead of using just machine or automation as an aid for testing, also use intellect alongside it as intellect is a serious and critical component that cannot be ignored.
 - Check (comply) vs Test (discover) - The Notion of compliance is checking and testing, which is actually discovering new things in the true sense.
 - Experience vs Method - Relying not only on experience but also on the method that allows us to think and do in addition to experience.
 - Detection vs preemption - It's not only about detection but also preemption and prevention.
 - Doing more vs To-Do Less - Instead of doing more, our focus should be on doing less and thinking more.

When we pick a component on right side on comparison points of Transformation focus then the smart testing begins i.e the notion of doing less and accomplishing more with meaningful thinking, appropriate tooling and well formed practices in addition to mature processes. This makes the assurance not only smarter but also meaningful.
 - 

>Where the shift will be : 
 - From an act of doing, we have to shift our focus to the act of probing continuously.
 - Along with that,t our next shift will be from doing more to doing less. 
 - Lastly, we have to shift our focus from the role of doer of testing activity to being a value deliverer through testing.


***Testing is deep probing, not mere code validation, and  requires smart thinking along with great habits.***


>For smart quality assurance, a deep probing mindset and building habits is required. 

| Typical Act that we need to do | Personal Transformation  | Enhanced | Outcomes  |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------|-----------|-----------|
| Do diligently                 | Of mindset             | Probe intelligently | Do effectively > Think well |
| Process Based                 | Of Activities          | Superior Practice | Do Efficiently |
| Experience Based              | Of Outcomes            | Method Based | Do Less & accomplish more |
| Reliance on Machine           | Of Roles & Values      | Intellect driven | -- |
| Detect                        | At Individual level    | Preempt | -- |
| Do More probing            | At Team Level       |  Do Less | -- |


>Smart testing is an intellectual practice of probing deeper to seek clarity and in the process, uncover and preempt issues rapidly, not limited to mere validation of code.

> Our agenda should be mentally active and physically lazy to do smart testing and achieve more. We should focus on doing the least amount of work and achieving the maximum amount of result.


Principles & Suggestions For Smart Quality Assurance: 
1. Time - While looking at time, we think of how we can do it faster.
2. Cost - The Same goes for cost that how can we achieve being cheaper?
3. Quality - How can we achieve and deliver good quality?

Balancing the above 3 points is difficult but important for smart quality assurance.
Since balancing this traid is difficult so we instead focus on : 

 - I can do what I do well  
 - I can do what I do quickly 
 -  I can do what ido early 
 - I can do what I do less 
 - I should avoid doing unnecessary work. if there is something I can avoid, I should completely avoid it.
