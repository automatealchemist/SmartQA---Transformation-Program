Introduction (Preamble): 

 - Limited View of Testing : We usually consider testing as an act of doing writing,executing test cases, etc. but that is a limited view, testing is not just about doing these task but also about questioning 
 -Incorrect Dichotomy : Manual and automation testing are incorrect dichotomy as automation testing is considered to be aid of manual testing,also some something is either manual task or automation task,
 - Incomplete View of Testing : Considering testing as bounded task of possibly compliance / checking however in real testing should not be bounded to these task instead testing should be an act of exploring the software, discovering something that hasnot been discovere yet, finding something new 
 - Limited Approach to Testing : Approach can be limited as people relies too much on documentation however in real there should be balance between execution and documentation 
 - False Trust : People also have thought that automated testing may be superior than manual testing however that's not the case
 - Myth of Testing : Another thought is that testing is driven by experience. However testing is not totally dependent on experience, having experience adds value to testing depending on how much have we learn from our mistakes. Experience is polished by discipline. When we do something with discipline we gain experience we become good, but not just by experience but also with certain amount of formalism and ability to apply the formalism which is ultimately embellished by experience.


# The TRANSFORMATION FOCUS 

 - Doing vs Probing - Instead of seeing the testing as a act of doing we should rather focus on seeing testing from an act of constantly intelligence probing point of view.
 - Process vs Practice - Again when it comes to testing instead of just focusing of process of doing the testing rather we should also see it as practice of testing i.e. how we do.
 - Machine vs Intellect - Instead of using just machine or automation as an aid for testing, also use intellect alongside with it as intellect is serious and critical component which cannot be ignored.
 - Check (comply) vs Test (discover) - Notion of compliance which is checking and testing which is actually discovering new things in true sense.
 - Experience vs Method - Relying not only on experience but also at the method that allow us to think and do in addition to experience.
 - Detection vs preemption - It's not only about detection but also preemption and prevention.
 - Doing more vs To-Do Less - Instead of doing more our focus should be on the doing less and thinking more.

When we pick component on right side on comparison points of Transformation focus then the smart testing begins i.e the notion of doing less and accomplishing more with meaningful thinking, appropriate tooling and well formed practices in addition to mature processes. This makes the assurance not only smarter but also meaningful.

>Where the shift will be : 
 - From an act of doing we have to shift our focus to act of probing continously.
 - Along with that our next shift will from doing more to doing less. 
 - Lastly we have to shift our focus from role of doer of testing activity to being a value deliverer through testing.


***Testing is deep probing not mere code validation, requires smart thinking along with great habits.***


>For smart quality assurance deep probing mindset and building habits is required. 

| Typical Act that we need to do | Personal Transformation  | Enhanced | Outcomes  |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------|-----------|-----------|
| Do diligently                 | Of mindset             | Probe intelligently | Do effectively > Think well |
| Process Based                 | Of Activities          | Superior Practice | Do Efficiently |
| Experience Based              | Of Outcomes            | Method Based | Do Less & accomplish more |
| Reliance on Machine           | Of Roles & Values      | Intellect driven | -- |
| Detect                        | At Individual level    | Preempt | -- |
| Do More probing            | At Team Level       |  Do Less | -- |


>Smart testing is an intellectual practice of probing deeper to seek clarity and in the process uncover, preempt issues rapidly, not limited to mere validation of code.

> Our agenda should be mentally active and physically lazy to do smart testing and achieve more. We should focus on doing least amount of work and achieve maximum amount of result.


Principles & Suggestions For Smart Quality Assurance: 
1. Time - While looking at time we think of how can we do faster.
2. Cost - Same goes for cost that how can we achieve being cheaper.
3. Quality - How can we achieve and deliver the good quality.

Balancing the above 3 points is difficult but important for smart quality assurance.
Since balancing this traid is difficult so we instead focus on : 

 - I can do what i do well  
 - I can do what i do quickly 
 -  I can do what ido early 
 - I can do what i do less 
 - I should avoid doing unnecessary work, if there is something i can avoid i should completely avoid
   that.
