# Introduction (Preamble): 

 - Limited View of Testing: We usually consider testing as an act of doing writing, executing test cases, etc., but that is a limited view, testing is not just about doing these tasks but also about questioning 
 -Incorrect Dichotomy: Manual and automation testing are incorrect dichotomy as automation testing is considered to be aid of manual testing, also some something is either manual task or automation task,
 - Incomplete View of Testing: Considering testing as the bounded task of possibly compliance / checking however, in real testing, it should not be bounded to these tasks Instead, testing should be an act of exploring the software, discovering something that has not been discovered yet, and finding something new 
 - Limited Approach to Testing: Approach can be limited as people rely too much on documentation however, in reality, there should be a balance between execution and documentation 
 - False Trust: People also think that automated testing may be superior to manual testing however, that's not the case
 - Myth of Testing: Another thought is that testing is driven by experience. However, testing is not totally dependent on experience, having experience adds value to testing depending on how much we have learn from our mistakes. Experience is polished by discipline. When we do something with discipline, we gain experience we become good, but not just by experience but also with a certain amount of formalism and ability to apply the formalism, which is ultimately embellished by experience.


# The TRANSFORMATION FOCUS 

 Doing vs. Probing: Instead of seeing testing as an act of doing, we should focus on seeing testing as an act of constantly probing intelligence.
 - Process vs Practice - Again, when it comes to testing, instead of just focusing of the process of doing the testing, we should also see it as the practice of testing, i.e. how we do.
 - Machine vs Intellect - Instead of using just machine or automation as an aid for testing, also use intellect alongside it as intellect is a serious and critical component that cannot be ignored.
 - Check (comply) vs Test (discover) - The Notion of compliance is checking and testing, which is actually discovering new things in the true sense.
 - Experience vs Method - Relying not only on experience but also on the method that allows us to think and do in addition to experience.
 - Detection vs preemption - It's not only about detection but also preemption and prevention.
 - Doing more vs To-Do Less - Instead of doing more, our focus should be on doing less and thinking more.

When we pick a component on right side on comparison points of Transformation focus then the smart testing begins i.e the notion of doing less and accomplishing more with meaningful thinking, appropriate tooling and well formed practices in addition to mature processes. This makes the assurance not only smarter but also meaningful.
 - 

>Where the shift will be : 
 - From an act of doing, we have to shift our focus to the act of probing continuously.
 - Along with that,t our next shift will be from doing more to doing less. 
 - Lastly, we have to shift our focus from the role of doer of testing activity to being a value deliverer through testing.


***Testing is deep probing, not mere code validation, and  requires smart thinking along with great habits.***


>For smart quality assurance, a deep probing mindset and building habits is required. 

| Typical Act that we need to do | Personal Transformation  | Enhanced | Outcomes  |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------|-----------|-----------|
| Do diligently                 | Of mindset             | Probe intelligently | Do effectively > Think well |
| Process Based                 | Of Activities          | Superior Practice | Do Efficiently |
| Experience Based              | Of Outcomes            | Method Based | Do Less & accomplish more |
| Reliance on Machine           | Of Roles & Values      | Intellect driven | -- |
| Detect                        | At Individual level    | Preempt | -- |
| Do More probing            | At Team Level       |  Do Less | -- |


>Smart testing is an intellectual practice of probing deeper to seek clarity and in the process, uncover and preempt issues rapidly, not limited to mere validation of code.

> Our agenda should be mentally active and physically lazy to do smart testing and achieve more. We should focus on doing the least amount of work and achieving the maximum amount of result.


Principles & Suggestions For Smart Quality Assurance: 
1. Time - While looking at time, we think of how we can do it faster.
2. Cost - The Same goes for cost that, how can we achieve being cheaper?
3. Quality - How can we achieve and deliver good quality?

Balancing the above 3 points is difficult but important for smart quality assurance.
Since balancing this traid is difficult, we instead focus on : 

 - I can do what I do well  
 - I can do what I do quickly 
 -  I can do what ido early 
 - I can do what I do less 
 - I should avoid doing unnecessary work. if there is something I can avoid, I should completely avoid it.
   

Some other suggestions for : 
1. Prioritize on focusing on where we are going rather than how fast we are going. As direction is more important than speed initially.
2. Focus on practice & process than pick tools. Understanding the best practices and processes of the organization where we work and then picking the tool accordingly will help us in achieving smart testing. 
3. Before picking automation scripts, focus on scenarios that need to be covered and why they need to be covered. 
4. Even though the qa documentation is important still, focus on writing less and doing more. 
5. Focus on test potency, not quantity, i.e., write effective test cases that bring better test results instead of writing the number of irrelevant test cases.
6. Again, instead of focusing on the number of issues, let's focus on the quality of the issues. 
7. Focus on the ket measure - "Escapes," i.e, the defect we missed, as they tell us a lot about our testing.
8. When it comes to defects we missed, it's not all about RCA, it's about our learning about the type of the defect and other details.
9. Using artificial intelligence as a tool for assistance for human intelligence 

>Testing is not about product validation, but it is about adding value to the context value to the organization value to the customer and ultimately value to the community.
>Our testing should be more focused on smart testing without disrupting the rhythm of the development.

***Testing is probing for issues pre-code and post-code. Probing can be at intellectual as well as physical level. Probing can be experiments, exploratory, etc., but probing cannot be just limited to code.***

 HyBIST = Hypothesis-based immersive session testing 
 which is the combination of hypothesis basis and immersion, which helps us in intelligent probing and observing.

Let's take an example - suppose we are suffering from abdominal pain and we approach 3 doctors. Then each of those 3 doctors may have different approaches for diagnosing our pain: 

1.  **One person prefers an invasive approach** â€“ They believe that to get the best results, they need to perform surgery (cut open the abdomen), even though it is difficult, costly, and involves more risk.
    
2.  **Another person prefers a logical, step-by-step approach** Instead of immediately jumping to surgery, they ask many questions, analyze symptoms, and use logical deduction to diagnose the issue. Once they have a strong suspicion, they confirm it with specific tests.
    
3.  **A third person prefers a minimally invasive approach** Instead of fully opening the body, they suggest using laparoscopy (a small camera inserted through a tiny cut) to examine the problem with minimal impact.

- Being testers, we don't have infinite time for testing, so when it comes to activity, then while doing probing, we have to do it smartly. 
- Another is the act of design, which is thinking and designing a smart idea.

HyBIST = Hypothesis basis+Immersive session. This hypothesis-based approach helps in coming up with an intelligent or smart approach or probes aided by key concepts(12), and the immersive session type testing approach helps in probing smartly enabled by key practices (5). 

 - The act of doing should be efficient, optimal, very mindful, and immersive.
 - Use tools wherever is possible for bringing better results, use those
   tools.
   
>We currently have 12 key concepts and 5 key practices, and the key concepts can be used at different levels of testing the  life-cycle, while key-practices are applicable across all parts of the life-cycle. 

We should choose to do less and accomplish more.
At the same time, it should be human-powered and machine-aided.
Also, we should focus on detecting the issues well and strive to prevent.
>Let's be lean and stay agile. The ultimate goal should be to do great work and deliver value.

## Testing vs Checking

During the waterfall days, testing was viewed as an act of checking for compliance. 

But with time, the definition of testing also evolved, and now it is more considered as exploration and discovery.

Great quality is about ensuring compliance and discovering potential gaps.
Checking is more of like we know something and we are ensuring that the software does not misbehave for that expecations.

We need to be more mindful while doing testing so that we can ensure that the testing done in the present is robust and, hence, the future of the software is secure and we don't need to be worried about the future bugs that may occur.


Checking is a well-formed comparison win in which tools can do as we know what to do and what we expect, and it can be automated. It can be based on specs and is more about wellness, while testing is more about illness in which we intentionally inject something and check the behavior to make the software resistant for the future.


| Checking                     | Testing                  |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------|
| is comparing                | is questioning           |
| can be scripted             | not always scripted      |
| binary outcome Pass/fail    | Outcome Pass/fail        |
| design approach - logical, experience | design approach - many |
| based on spec               | beyond spec              |
| wellness                    | illness                  |

>Testing is a brilliant combination of checking for expected outcomes, exploring the whole, looking for the unexpected, uncovering issues, suggesting needs not yet thought of, improving what is done, and sensitizing to prevent issues.
"Testing" really is a gateway to doing good work and producing systems of value.
